Practice

I have no idea what I'm actually doing. I just really want to scan my paper coupons and have the information about them 
actually pop up and save to a coupon inventory list in an app. 

But apparently it's impossible because none of the apps that I have found ever actually work.

Am I asking for too much? 

I just want an app that: 
       
      1. Let's me autofill product descriptions by scanning barcodes of the products in my home, to keep an 
          inventory of what I have. With customizable room categories and options to breakdown the rooms into subcategories of 
          storage units in each room.
       
      2. Let's me create a weekly/biweekly/monthly meal plan with suggestions from my pantry, refrigerator, cabinets, and 
          freezer inventories. And also have an online recipe database to search and add items to shopping lists.
      
      3. Let's me create customizable shopping lists. With the option to create separate store lists and have categories for 
          the products/aisles. I would like to have the option to manually enter sales prices and have my subtotal before & 
          After savings, Plus taxes, And total.
      
      4. Let's me scan my paper coupons and autofill the coupon information, from an online database, and saving the coupons 
          into my coupon binder inventory. I want to be able to manually enter and scan products into shopping lists and 
          automatically get notified of a match up of products I need and coupons I have. 
      
      5. Let's me create a price book, for each store I shop at, of the items/brands that I frequently purchase and add the 
          price and price per unit, to items added to a shopping list. 
          
 Maybe it is a lot... But I suppose that's why I have chosen to learn how to create my own app. 
 
 Wish me luck!
